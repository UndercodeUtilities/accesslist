Privilege escalation in Hashicorp Nomad
CVE-2021-37218

A vulnerability was identified in Nomad and Nomad Enterprise (“Nomad”) such that client agents can escalate privileges by 
directly communicating with the server agent’s Raft RPC layer. This vulnerability, CVE-2021-37218, was fixed in Nomad 1.0.10 and 1.1.4.

Background
Nomad uses mTLS for agent communication between Nomad client and server agents. This provides an encrypted and authenticated RPC channel. A subset of the available server RPC functionality is meant to be exposed to client agents, with the others intended for server agent usage only.

Details
During internal testing, it was observed that using a non-server certificate from the configured Nomad CA enables access to server-only Raft RPC functionality.

Nomad’s RPC authentication logic has been modified to correctly enforce server-only access for the Raft RPC layer.
