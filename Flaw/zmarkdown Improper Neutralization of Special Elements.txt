Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') in ZMarkdown


A Remote Command Execution vulnerability was found in the rebber module,
which allowed execution of arbitrary commands. The reported problem came
from CodeBlocks, which could be escaped to insert malicious LaTeX.

Anyone using rebber without sanitation of code content or a custom
macro is impacted by this vulnerability. Here is an example of a Markdown
content that will exploit the vulnerability:

```
\end{CodeBlock}

\immediate\write18{COMMAND > outputrce}
\input{outputrce}

\begin{CodeBlock}{text}
```
Will insert into the generated LaTeX the result of executing
COMMAND on the system.
