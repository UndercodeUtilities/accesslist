Infinite loop in TFLite
Affected versions
< 2.3.4

The strided slice implementation in TFLite has a logic bug which can allow an attacker to trigger an infinite loop. This arises from newly introduced support for ellipsis in axis definition:

  for (int i = 0; i < effective_dims;) {
    if ((1 << i) & op_context->params->ellipsis_mask) {
      // ...
      int ellipsis_end_idx =
          std::min(i + 1 + num_add_axis + op_context->input_dims - begin_count,
                   effective_dims);
      // ...
      for (; i < ellipsis_end_idx; ++i) {
        // ...
      }
      continue;
    }
    // ...
    ++i;
  }
An attacker can craft a model such that ellipsis_end_idx is smaller than i (e.g., always negative). In this case, the inner loop does not increase i and the continue statement causes execution to skip over the preincrement at the end of the outer loop.
