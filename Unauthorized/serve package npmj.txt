Handling of URL Encoding permitting access to ignored:

Create a file serving listing application that runs serve, and configure a few directories and files to ignore in the ignore settings.

const serve = require('serve')
const server = serve(__dirname, {
	  port: 1337,
	  ignore: ['testfolder', 'test.txt']
})
Run:
$ node filename.js

With the exception of the folder testfolder and the file test.txt, the current directory will now be served by serve.
We receive a Not Found message when we try to curl test.txt.



$ curl http://localhost:1337/t%65st.txt
this is a forbidden file :D

$ curl http://localhost:1337/t%65st.txt
this is a forbidden file :D
(Access)

For all dir:

$ curl http://localhost:1337/t%65stfolder/
